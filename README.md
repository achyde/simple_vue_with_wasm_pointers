## A Vue/WASM App With A Function That Takes C Struct Pointers For Arguments

This repository contains a simple Vue application that illustrates how to use a WASM module with a function that takes struct pointers for arguments. The WASM module is built using C that has a function that accepts struct pointers for arguments.

This is a companion repository to the blog post [How to use C struct pointers in WASM](https://www.andrewchyde.com/blog/posts/C%20Struct%20Pointers%20In%20WASM%20With%20Vue.html).
